Perfect! Now the plugin should work correctly. The updated plugin includes:

Comprehensive Query Filtering:
pre_get_posts filter for both admin and frontend
REST API filtering with rest_sfwd-quiz_query
AJAX request handling
Direct WHERE clause modification for custom queries
Enhanced Debugging: All functions now log their activity so you can see exactly what's happening
Multiple Capability Checks: Enhanced capability filtering for various quiz-related permissions
Now let's test this. Try accessing the instructor dashboard again and check the debug log to see what's happening. The logs will show:

When queries are being processed
Whether the instructor role is detected
How queries are being modified
What capabilities are being granted
Check your 
wp-content/debug.log
 file for entries starting with "Teacher Quiz Permissions" to see the detailed debugging information.

 //     $permissions = new Teacher_Quiz_Permissions();
//     $permissions->grant_quiz_permissions($teacher);
//     error_log("Teacher Quiz Permissions: Manually updated permissions for TEST12");
// }

// Allow instructors to see all quizzes - Admin Backend
add_action('pre_get_posts', 'allow_instructors_see_all_quizzes', 999);
