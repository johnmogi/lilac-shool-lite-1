Let's check the structure of the edc_learndash_user_activity table to see how group leader assignments are tracked. This will help us understand the current state of group assignments and identify any potential issues.

sql
SELECT * 
FROM edc_learndash_user_activity 
WHERE activity_type = 'group' 
  AND (post_id IN (9762, 9774, 9805, 9876, 10013, 10014, 10015, 10016, 10017, 10020)
      OR user_id IN (1, 6, 14))
LIMIT 20;
This query will help us see if there are any activity records related to the groups and users we've identified. Please run this in the MySQL terminal and share the results.

Also, could you please check the browser's developer console (F12) for any JavaScript errors when you try to open the teacher group assignment popup? This will help us identify if there are any frontend issues preventing the popup from working correctly.

Let's check the browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors when opening the teacher group assignment popup. This will help us identify any frontend issues.

Open the WordPress admin dashboard
Go to the Teachers page in the School Manager Lite plugin
Click the "Assign Groups" button for a teacher
Open the browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click -> Inspect)
Go to the Console tab
Look for any error messages
Could you please share any error messages you see in the console? This will help us identify if there are any JavaScript issues preventing the popup from working correctly.

Also, please check the Network tab in the developer tools for any failed AJAX requests when clicking the "Assign Groups" button. Look for any requests to admin-ajax.php that might be failing.

I see the groups data is being loaded correctly. Let's check the AJAX request for the teacher group assignment form. Could you:

Open the browser's developer tools (F12)
Go to the Network tab
Click the "Assign Groups" button for a teacher
Look for a request to admin-ajax.php with the action 
get_teacher_group_assignment_form
Share the request payload and response
This will help us understand why the form content isn't loading in the Thickbox. The issue might be related to how the response is being handled in the JavaScript code.

Let's update the plan with our recent findings and the current state of the issue:

Planned for 15s

View Plan
Hereâ€™s a summary of the plan update:

Added notes confirming that LearnDash groups and group leader assignments exist and are being loaded in the AJAX response.
Updated the task list to mark the "Test that the popup loads correct content for teacher group assignment" as in progress, since the AJAX is returning data but the modal is still empty.
Clarified that the current goal is to fix modal content display and ensure the correct form is shown.
Now updating the plan.

Added
Test that the popup loads correct content for teacher group assignment (AJAX returns data, modal empty)
Fix modal content display and ensure correct form is shown
Let's check the PHP AJAX handler for the teacher group assignment form to ensure it's returning the correct HTML structure. I'll look at the relevant code in the admin class.

Analyzed
class-admin.php#L50-150
Let's check the JavaScript code that handles the AJAX response and modal population. I'll look at the admin.js file where the teacher group assignment functionality is implemented.

Analyzed
admin.js#L300-400
Let me check the rest of the JavaScript code to see how the AJAX response is being handled and how the modal content is being populated.

Analyzed
admin.js#L380-480
I've identified the issue with the teacher group assignment popup. The problem lies in how the AJAX response is being handled. Let me explain the issue and provide a fix.

The Problem:
The PHP AJAX handler is returning raw HTML directly, but the JavaScript expects a JSON response with a data property.
The JavaScript is trying to access response.data but the PHP is not wrapping the HTML in a JSON response.
The Fix:
Let's modify the PHP AJAX handler to return a proper JSON response:

php
// In class-admin.php, modify the ajax_get_teacher_group_assignment_form method
public function ajax_get_teacher_group_assignment_form() {
    // ... existing permission and validation checks ...
    
    // Get the form HTML
    ob_start();
    // ... existing form HTML generation code ...
    $html = ob_get_clean();
    
    // Return as JSON with success status
    wp_send_json_success($html);
    
    // Make sure to exit to prevent any extra output
    wp_die();
}
Next Steps:
I'll implement this fix in the code.
Then we should test the popup to ensure it works correctly.
Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with these changes.

Completed
Clean reimplementation of modal logic in admin.js
I've successfully restructured the teacher assignment modal functionality in admin.js. Here's a summary of the improvements:

Code Organization:
Created a clean, modular teacherAssignmentModal object
Separated concerns with clear method responsibilities
Added proper error handling and user feedback
Key Features:
Proper initialization of the modal
AJAX loading of the group assignment form
Form submission handling with loading states
Error handling and user feedback
Cleanup on modal close
Fixes:
Removed duplicate code and declarations
Fixed syntax errors
Improved error handling for AJAX requests
Added proper cleanup of modal elements
Next Steps:
Test the modal functionality
Verify the AJAX endpoint returns the correct form HTML
Check for any remaining JavaScript errors in the console
To test the changes:

Go to the teachers list page
Click the "Assign Groups" button for a teacher
Verify the modal opens with the correct content
Test form submission and error handling
Would you like me to help with testing or make any adjustments to the implementation?
